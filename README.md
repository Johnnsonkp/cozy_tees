### [R7][R8] Identification of the problem and why it need solving


The perfect T-Shirt is completely subjective to the individuals taste when it comes to design, however there are 3 main criterias that can contribute to the perfect T-Shirt, These are: 
- Fit
- Quality
- Price 

The problem though is that the traditional fashion business model leaves two options for T-Shirt lovers: cheap and low quality or inflated and higher quality. 

In our quest for the perfect T-Shirt its not very often we find ourselves a T-Shirt that is of higher quality, good fit and is affordable, but when we do, we must cherish it, that is the T-Shirt ofcourse. 

For the other times we find ourselves a T-Shirt that for whatever reason isn't right for us what do we do? worst case scenerio we send it back to the manufacturer and get store credit. Best case scenario we get a refund but have to deal with lengthy back and forth communication with the manufacturer hoping they will give is a refund.

There must be a faster way to get rid of the T-Shirt without losing our money right....

See in a world where our presentation has a direct impact on how we are treated, from getting that promotion at work, to dating that dream partner . Presentation is everything, and  presentation starts with our T-Shirt.

Cozy Tees is a two-sided-marketplace application that allows users to buy and sell T-Shirts. The two-sided-marketplacese caters for sellers who are trying to sell a T-Shirt that may have been an accidental buy or doesn't fit anymore and isn't what they expected. It also caters for buyers who are looking to buy quality affordable T-Shirts that are within their area. 

Cozy Tees also caters to sporting fans, our sporting section has all that you need to look like a part of your favourite team/teams.
